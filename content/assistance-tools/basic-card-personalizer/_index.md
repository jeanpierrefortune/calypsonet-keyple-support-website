#### What is the Calypso Basic Card Personalization Tool?  

The Calypso Basic Card Personalization Tool is a desktop application designed for personalizing **Calypso Basic** cards by
injecting Application Identifiers (AID) and security keys.

**Key Features:**
- **AID and Key Injection**: Enables the injection of AID and encryption keys into a blank **Calypso Basic** card.
- **Dual Reader Setup**: Requires a Target Card Reader for the blank card and a SAM Reader containing the **SAM CPP** for secure key injection.

#### Why use the Calypso Basic Card Personalization Tool?

This tool is essential for operators seeking to personalize **Calypso Basic** cards for use on their network by
injecting keys stored in the **SAM CV/CV** available in the field. It utilizes a **SAM CPP** that has
been personalized using the [basic-legacysam-personalizer](../basic-legacysam-personalizer/) tool.

<br>

This user guide explains how to personalize a **Calypso Basic** card (AID and keys injection).

<br>

## Hardware Requirements

This tool requires two PC/SC readers:
