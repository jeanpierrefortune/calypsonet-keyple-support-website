This tutorial will guide you through the process of personalizing a Calypso Basic card.

## Hardware Requirements

This tool requires two PC/SC readers:

* **Target Card Reader:** This contactless reader holds the **blank card** you want to personalize.
* **SAM Reader:** This contact reader contains the **SAM CPP** used for keys injection.

## Installation

1. The software is available in a GitHub repository. Go to
   the [releases page](https://github.com/calypsonet/cna-tool-basic-legacysam-perso-app/releases) to download it. (Note:
   the GitHub repository is private. Please request access from [CNA](https://calypsonet.org)). Choose the installation
   file that matches your operating system:
    * **Windows:** `.msi` package
    * **macOS:** `.dmg` package
    * **Linux:** `.deb` package
2. **Windows:** Double-click the `.msi` package to start the installation process.
3. **macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file and drag the application to the Applications folder.
4. **Linux:** Use your distribution's package manager to install the `.deb` package.
5. **Important note:** Currently, the installer does not automatically create a shortcut in the Start Menu (Windows) or
   Applications menu (macOS). If you want quick access, you will need to create a shortcut manually.

## Launch the Tool

1. Once the installation is complete, you can find the executable in the installation directory. The default location
   varies depending on your operating system:
    * **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\cna-tool-basic-card-perso-app\`
    * **macOS:** `/Applications/cna-tool-basic-card-perso-app/`
    * **Linux:** `/opt/cna-tool-basic-card-perso-app/` (or in your user's home directory if you installed it
      locally)
2. Double-click the executable to launch the **Calypso Basic Card Personalization Tool**.

## Application UI

The application window has a top menu and two tabs:

### Settings Menu

1. Click the **Settings** menu.
2. Select the **Target Card Reader** name. This is where you will present your blank Calypso Basic card.
3. Select the **SAM Reader** name.
4. Enter the **SAM Unlock Value** if required.
5. Select the directory for the log file.

### Tabs

* **Basic Card Personalization:** Configure and personalize the card. Set parameters like AID, KVC, and KIFs, and
  start/stop the personalization process.
* **Application Info:** View logs and events related to the application and card reader. Useful for troubleshooting.

## Personalize a Card

1. Select the **Basic Card Personalization** tab.
2. Insert the **SAM CPP** into the SAM reader.
3. Enter the personalization parameters:
    * **AID**
    * **System keys KVC**
    * **Work keys KIF and KVC**
4. Click **Start** to begin scanning for the card.
5. Present a blank card to the card reader's antenna.

## Refresh Reader Detection

If you connect or disconnect card readers while the application is running, switch between the tabs (Basic Card
Personalization, Application Info) to make the application recognize the changes.
