The Android NFC plugin is used to communicate with the contactless card, and the Calypso card commands are fully managed by the back-office ticketing server using the Keyple Distributed solution. On the server side, the back-office includes a Java server application to process the ticketing sale and manage the Calypso secure session to reload contracts in remote cards. The server manages a pool of Calypso SAM using the PC/SC plugin and the Calypso SAM resource manager. Close Validation Android Java/Kotlin Open Source Demo Validation × This demo can be installed on various terminals such as Coppernic, Famoco, Flowbird, and Bluebird provided by CNA. For further information and guides on these demos, please visit the CNA website. Scenario: An autonomous validator on Android-based ticketing terminal that seamlessly starts a secure session when a contactless card is detected. The machine checks the last transport event and the available ticketing contracts. If access is granted, a new event is written. Close Control Android Java/Kotlin Open Source Demo Control × This demo can be installed on various terminals such as Coppernic, Famoco, Flowbird, and Bluebird provided by CNA. For further information and guides on these demos, please visit the CNA website. Scenario: A hand-held inspection terminal on Android portable terminal that allows an operator to check the content of a card. The application verifies the validity of the last transport event regarding the current time and location. Finally, it displays the result.
