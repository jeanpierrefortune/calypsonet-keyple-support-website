The Android NFC plugin is used to communicate with the contactless card, and the Calypso card commands are fully managed by the back-office ticketing server using the Keyple Distributed solution. On the server side, the back-office includes a Java server application to process the ticketing sale and manage the Calypso secure session to reload contracts in remote cards. The server manages a pool of Calypso SAM using the PC/SC plugin and the Calypso SAM resource manager. Close Validation Android Java/Kotlin Open Source Demo Validation × This demo can be installed on various terminals such as Coppernic, Famoco, Flowbird, and Bluebird provided by CNA. For further information and guides on these demos, please visit the CNA website. Scenario: An autonomous validator on Android-based ticketing terminal that seamlessly starts a secure session when a contactless card is detected. The machine checks the last transport event and the available ticketing contracts. If access is granted, a new event is written. Close Control Android Java/Kotlin Open Source Demo Control × This demo can be installed on various terminals such as Coppernic, Famoco, Flowbird, and Bluebird provided by CNA. For further information and guides on these demos, please visit the CNA website. Scenario: A hand-held inspection terminal on Android portable terminal that allows an operator to check the content of a card. The application verifies the validity of the last transport event regarding the current time and location. Finally, it displays the result.

The tool reads its data to display its current state and then writes the new configuration during personalization. Origin SAM Reader: This reader contains the SAM SP with the desired keys and settings that you want to inject into the target SAM CPP. Installation Download the appropriate installation package for your operating system from the download page: Windows: .msi package macOS: .dmg package Linux: .deb package Windows: Double-click the .msi package to start the installation process. macOS: Open the .dmg file and drag the application to the Applications folder. Linux: Use your distribution’s package manager to install the .deb package. Important note: Currently, the installer does not automatically create a shortcut in the Start Menu (Windows) or Applications menu (macOS). If you want quick access, you will need to create a shortcut manually. Launching the Tool Once the installation is complete, you can find the executable in the installation directory. The default location varies depending on your operating system: Windows: C:\\\\Program Files\\\\cna-tool-basic-legacysam-perso-app\\\\ macOS: /Applications/cna-tool-basic-legacysam-perso-app/ Linux: /opt/cna-tool-basic-legacysam-perso-app/ (or in your user’s home directory if you installed it locally) Double-click the executable to launch the Calypso Basic Legacy SAM Personalization Tool. The tool will open with the SAM Dump tab selected. Application interface The application window has a top menu and three tabs:\nSettings menu entry Select the Settings menu. Select the Target SAM Reader name from the drop-down list. This is where your blank SAM should be inserted. Select the Origin SAM Reader name from the drop-down list. This SAM contains the data you want to transfer to the target SAM. Enter the Origin SAM Unlock Value in the text field, if required. Tabs SAM Dump: Shows the detailed information and parameters of the SAM inserted in the target SAM reader. This allows you to view the SAM’s current state before and after personalization. SAM Personalization: Allows you to configure and execute the personalization process. You can choose which parameters to transfer, and inject them into a blank target SAM. You can also export/import the personalization settings. Application Info: Displays logs and events related to the application and SAM readers, which can be useful for troubleshooting. Creating a SAM CPP Select the SAM Personalization tab. Insert a virgin SAM in the target SAM reader. Insert the SAM SP in the origin SAM reader. Set the parameters such as parameter version and owner data (informative) system keys KVC work keys KIF and KVC Lock parameters Click the “Execute” button to inject the parameters and keys into the blank SAM. The tool will personalize your SAM by writing the parameters and transferring the keys from the origin SAM to the target SAM. Refreshing Reader Detection If you connect or disconnect SAM readers while the application is running, you might need to switch between the tabs ( SAM Dump, SAM Personalization, Application Info) for the application to recognize the changes.\nScreenshots Installation Settings SAM dump SAM personalization Application info Disclaimer This tool is provided by CNA for its members.
