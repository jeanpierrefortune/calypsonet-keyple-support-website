The CNA Tool Card Analyzer App Suite consists of two command-line tools:\nTool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure: analyzes the file structure of a Calypso smart card and generates a JSON report containing the card’s structure and application data. Tool_CheckCardFileStructure: checks the file structure of a Calypso card against a given JSON file containing the expected file structure. Why use the CNA Tool Card Analyzer App Suite? This suite helps developers and testers:\nUnderstand the data stored on a Calypso card. Verify compliance with Calypso specifications. Troubleshoot potential issues. Compare card structure against a predefined template. The following sections provide detailed instructions on using the CNA Tool Card Analyzer App Suite to retrieve and analyze the contents of a Calypso card and to verify its compliance against a reference file.\nPrerequisites Java: ensure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. You can download it from www.java.com. PC/SC card reader: a contactless PC/SC compliant card reader is required to interact with the Calypso card. Download the Apps Go to the releases page to download the latest version of the application suite. Download the executable JAR files: Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar Tool_CheckCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar Analyze a Card Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar. Place your Calypso card on the reader. Execute the following command: java -jar Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar [readerNameRegex] readerNameRegex (optional): a regular expression to filter the card readers. If not provided, a default regex ( .*(ASK.*|Identiv.*2|ACS ACR122U|SCR3310).*) is used. The analysis results will be displayed in the terminal and JSON file containing the card structure will be saved. Supported AID Prefixes The Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure is configured to recognize and analyze Calypso cards with specific AID prefixes. The supported prefixes are:\nA000000291 A000000404 D276000085 334D54522E 315449432E 304554502E If the card’s DF Name does not match one of the supported AID prefixes, you will need to update the configuration in the source code to include the new AID prefix and recompile the application for proper analysis.\nJSON Output The JSON output generated by Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure provides a structured view of the Calypso smart card data analyzed. Below is an explanation of the key fields found in the JSON output:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;infos\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;software\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;traceability\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;applicationList\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;fci\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;calypsoRevision\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;aid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;applicationType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;applicationSubtype\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;issuer\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;csn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;csnDec\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sessionModif\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sessionModifDec\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bufferSize\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;revision\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;transactionCounter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;transactionCounterDec\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;accessConditions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group0\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;group1\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;group2\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;group3\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kif1\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kif2\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kif3\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kvc1\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kvc2\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kvc3\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fileList\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;sfi\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;efType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recSize\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recSizeDec\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;numRec\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;numRecDec\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;accessConditions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group0\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;group1\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;group2\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;group3\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessCondition\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyLevel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;ref\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recordDataList\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } ] } ] } ] } Field Descriptions id: string, unique identifier for the profile. infos: string, type of analysis performed (e.g., \u0026#34;AnalyzeCardFileStructure\u0026#34;). date: string, date and time when the analysis was conducted. version: integer, JSON model version. software: string, name of the software used for analysis (e.g., \u0026#34;Calypso Card Analyzer\u0026#34;). traceability: string, hexadecimal string encoding traceability information for auditing.
