[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Discover more about CNA here\nGet in touch with the CNA team for more information\nCalypso Networks Association (CNA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to improve contactless electronic ticketing for transportation and access control standards since 2003. For many years, our mission has been to create innovative solutions that are fully interoperable, reliable, secure, and open. We collaborate with a dynamic network of city leaders and transport authorities that are keen to work with system integrators with Calypso® standard expertise.\nDiscover more about CNA here: http://calypsonet.org\nCalypso Networks Association offers comprehensive technical support and documentation to ensure all users can get the most out of Calypso® technology and Eclipse Keyple®.\nCalypso Networks Association provides a Calypso Test Kit. The Calypso Test Kit aims at helping ticketing system developers to fully experience Eclipse Keyple® with a set of Calypso® SAM and Calypso® certified portable objects from several manufacturers in various configurations.\nReader plugins Name Device Interface OS Language License Access Info Coppernic C-One v2 Internal Android Java/Kotlin EPL-2.0 Open Source Famoco FX100, FX105, FX200, FX205, FX300, FX915, FX920 Internal Android Java/Kotlin EPL-2.0 Open Source Flowbird Axio Touch Validator/MTBorne validator, Magnetic Axio Touch Validator, Axio 4 Validator, Infigo Driver Console, Voyager Embedded Ticketing Vending Machine, Coppernic C-One, Coppernic C-One V2, Zebra TC77, ACTIA PSDT Internal Android Java/Kotlin Flowbird Restricted Bluebird EF501, EF551 Internal Android Java/Kotlin Bluebird Restricted Legacy HSM Spirtech HSM IP Windows, Linux, macOS Java/Kotlin Spirtech Restricted Demos Name OS Language Access Info Reload Remote Windows, Linux, macOS, Android Java/Kotlin, C# Open Source Demo Reload Remote × This demo requires a client/server environment: On the client side, an Android application loaded in a standard NFC smartphone provides the means to a customer to make the ticket purchase. The Android NFC plugin is used to communicate with the contactless card, and the Calypso card commands are fully managed by the back-office ticketing server using the Keyple Distributed solution. On the server side, the back-office includes a Java server application to process the ticketing sale and manage the Calypso secure session to reload contracts in remote cards. The server manages a pool of Calypso SAM using the PC/SC plugin and the Calypso SAM resource manager. Close Validation Android Java/Kotlin Open Source Demo Validation × This demo can be installed on various terminals such as Coppernic, Famoco, Flowbird, and Bluebird provided by CNA. For further information and guides on these demos, please visit the CNA website. Scenario: An autonomous validator on Android-based ticketing terminal that seamlessly starts a secure session when a contactless card is detected. The machine checks the last transport event and the available ticketing contracts. If access is granted, a new event is written.

Tool_CheckCardFileStructure: checks the file structure of a Calypso card against a given JSON file containing the expected file structure. Why use the CNA Tool Card Analyzer App Suite?\nThis suite helps developers and testers:\nUnderstand the data stored on a Calypso card. Verify compliance with Calypso specifications. Troubleshoot potential issues. Compare card structure against a predefined template. Prerequisites Java: ensure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. You can download it from www.java.com. PC/SC card reader: a contactless PC/SC compliant card reader is required to interact with the Calypso card. Download the Apps Go to the releases page to download the latest version of the application suite. Download the executable JAR files: Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar Tool_CheckCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar Run the Apps Analyze a Card (Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure) Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar. Place your Calypso card on the reader. Execute the following command: java -jar Tool_AnalyzeCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar [readerNameRegex] readerNameRegex (optional): a regular expression to filter the card readers. If not provided, a default regex ( .*(ASK.*|Identiv.*2|ACS ACR122U|SCR3310).*) is used. The analysis results will be displayed in the terminal and JSON file containing the card structure will be saved. Check a card structure (Tool_CheckCardFileStructure) Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing Tool_CheckCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar. Obtain a JSON file defining the expected card structure: You can use a pre-defined JSON file from the card_profiles directory in the GitHub repository. The file names indicate the type of product they correspond to. Alternatively, you can create your own JSON file defining the expected structure. Place your Calypso card on the reader and keep it still. Execute the following command: java -jar Tool_CheckCardFileStructure-x.y.z.jar \u0026lt;path-to-json-file\u0026gt; [readerNameRegex] \u0026lt;path-to-json-file\u0026gt;: (Required) The path to the JSON file containing the expected card structure. This argument should be replaced with the actual path to your JSON file (e.g., card_profiles/my_card_profile.json). readerNameRegex (optional): a regular expression to filter the card readers. If not provided, a default regex (.*(ASK.*|Identiv.*2|ACS ACR122U|SCR3310).*) is used. The tool will compare the card’s structure with the provided JSON file and display any differences. Troubleshooting Card not found: ensure your card reader is correctly connected and installed, and that the card is presented correctly. Java not found: ensure Java is installed and that its directory is added to your system’s PATH environment variable. Error messages: carefully read any error messages displayed in the terminal for clues on how to resolve the issue.
